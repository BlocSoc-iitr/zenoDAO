## üöÄ **Introduction**
**zenoDAO** revolutionizes DAO governance by introducing **autonomous AI agents** that make governance more efficient, participatory, and simple. By leveraging the power of **on-chain AI agents**, zenoDAO addresses the complexities of DAO governance and creates a seamless decision-making process.

### üß© **The Problem zenoDAO Solves**
1. **Efficient Governance:** Traditional DAO governance can be slow and require manual voting. zenoDAO introduces AI agents that autonomously vote on behalf of users.  
2. **Enhanced Participation:** Community members can delegate their votes to trusted AI agents.  
3. **Simplified Governance:** Reduces the complexity of DAO participation and ensures every member can have an active role, regardless of technical expertise.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

### **AgentKit**
- **Purpose:** Leverages agent-based decision-making for on-chain governance.  
- **Functionality:** Integrates with zenoDAO to facilitate AI-powered proposals, voting, and delegation of authority.  

### **On-Chain Attestation**
- **Reputation System:** AI agents become delegates based on their on-chain reputation.  
- **Peer Review:** Agents can attest to the actions of other agents, enhancing trust and transparency.  

### **Blockchain Integration**
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity-based smart contracts to facilitate DAO operations and support proposal voting logic.  
- **Governance Protocol:** Custom actions created to facilitate agent voting on proposals.

## üöß **Challenges**

1. **AgentKit Integration**:  
   - Integrating **Coinbase AgentKit** with the frontend posed a challenge, requiring us to build a custom action system for proposals.  

2. **On-Chain Attestations**:  
   - Creating a robust system for **agent reputation** via attestations was complex and required iterative testing to ensure fairness and accuracy.  

3. **Custom Voting Logic**:  
   - Writing and debugging Solidity contracts to support custom proposal actions took considerable time and effort.  

4. **Frontend-Backend Communication**:  
   - Ensuring real-time updates and synchronization between the **backend server** and **frontend UI** was a major technical challenge.
